# Il nostro pianeta 🚀

---

## Overview

**Brief description**  
My project is a web application built with React, aimed at raising awareness about climate change by displaying graphs of NO2, CO2, methane, and temperature levels over the past years. Within the app, I have dedicated a section that explains the importance of taking action against climate change and offers the user concrete actions they can take to improve the environmental situation. Among the possibilities, the user can become a member of WWF, purchase products, or simply get informed.
